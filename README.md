This is a collaborative project built in a day for AppHack 2024, built by Riley Richardson and Josh Howard.

The premise is as follows:

1. Four monkeys sit at a type writer, waiting for a word to write.
2. You are betting on one of those monkeys to guess your word.
3. You are confident enough that you are willing to place a bet on which monkey will win the word race.
4. finally, you give them a word to write.
5. The monkeys scramble to guess the word randomly until one wins.
6. If you picked the right monkey, you win money!
